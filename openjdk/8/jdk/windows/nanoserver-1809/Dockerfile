# > While it is true that the OpenJDK Governing Board has not sanctioned those releases, they (or rather we, since I am a member) didn't sanction Oracle's OpenJDK releases either. As far as I am aware, the lead of an OpenJDK project is entitled to release binary builds, and there is clearly a need for them.
